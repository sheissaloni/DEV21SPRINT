# DEV21SPRINT
The Development challenge 
DevSprint21, is an exhilarating 21-day development marathon hosted by Protègè!

The title for my project is TrackHub!!
TrackHub is a centralized platform designed to help students manage and track all events they participate in. It alleviates the need to remember every detail by providing a comprehensive system that keeps all information in one place. 

Key features of my project are:
-> Register/Login
-> Event Management
-> Application Management
-> Frequently Used Details

1) Event Management:
   Add, view, and manage details of workshops, seminars, contests, and other events.
   List of all upcoming and past events (workshops, seminars, conferences, etc.).
   Detailed information about each event, including date, time, location, speakers, and topics.

2) Application Management:
   Internships and Job Applications: A dedicated section to manage and track applications for internships and jobs and having important details about it like job descriptions, durations, and follow-up statuses.
   Store and fill out necessary application forms directly through the platform by storing URLs.

3) User Profile:
   Store and manage frequently used personal details.
   Easy retrieval and auto-fill details when applying for jobs or internships.
